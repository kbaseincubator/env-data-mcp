            "The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, "
            "Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides data beginning in 1980. It was introduced "
            "to replace the original MERRA dataset because of the advances made in "
            "the assimilation system that enable assimilation of modern hyperspectral "
            "radiance and microwave observations, along with GPS-Radio Occultation "
            "datasets. It also uses NASA's ozone profile observations that began in "
            "late 2004. Additional advances in both the GEOS model and the GSI "
            "assimilation system are included in MERRA-2. Spatial resolution remains "
            "about the same (about 50 km in the latitudinal direction) as in MERRA. "
            "Along with the enhancements in the meteorological assimilation, MERRA-2 "
            "takes some significant steps towards GMAO's target of an Earth System "
            "reanalysis. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate "
            "space-based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions "
            "with other physical processes in the climate system. MERRA-2 includes a "
